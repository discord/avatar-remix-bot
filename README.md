## Avatar Remix

Avatar Remix is a Discord bot that lets you edit your friends' profile pictures in fun and sometimes unexpected ways.

![avatar remix example](https://www.ianww.com/avatar-remix/catluvr2.png)

## How it works

The main functionality of Avatar Remix is provided by [instruct-pix2pix](https://www.timothybrooks.com/instruct-pix2pix), a model based on Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on a large dataset of example prompts generated by GPT-3.

Discord profile pictures are often pretty small, so if necessary we use [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) to upscale for better results.

This app runs as a Cloudflare Worker and uses the [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) API to run the above models serverlessly.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

This bot runs on Node and its package manager, npm. If you don't already have node and npm set up, [following this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Install the bot's dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Set up external accounts

This bot uses [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Replicate](https://replicate.com/). You'll need to:

- Set up `wrangler` locally ([see Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/))
- Get a [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account)

### Create a Discord application

Create a new application on the [Discord Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then, in the "Bot" settings tab of your application, click "Add Bot" (we don't actually need this bot user, but we use its token for convenience...)

See the [Getting Started](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started) guide on the Discord developer portal for more details.

### Envars and secrets

Set up envars in `wrangler.toml`:

- Update `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` with values from the application you created in the previous step.
- Update `WORKER_BASE_URL` with the URL of your Cloudflare worker. By default, this URL takes the form `https://avatar-remix-bot.<your worker username>.workers.dev`.

Use wrangler to store secret tokens for your bot by running the following commands:

- `wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - obtain this token by clicking "View Token" on the Bot page
- `wrangler secret put REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - obtain this token from your Replicate account settings

### KV store and Queues

This bot uses Cloudflare to host some serverless infrastructure.

First, it uses [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/) in order to track Replicate jobs and match callbacks with the original jobs. Run the following command to create the KV namespace:

```
wrangler kv:namespace create AVATAR_REMIX_FOLLOWUPS
```

Take the output and paste it into `wrangler.toml`, replacing the placeholder binding for `AVATAR_REMIX_FOLLOWUPS`.

Second, it uses [Cloudflare Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/javascript-apis/) to stay within Replicate rate limits during periods of heavy load (this isn't necessary unless you think a lot of people will use your app):

```
wrangler queues create avatar-remix-jobs
```

### Publish the Cloudflare Worker

It's time to bring your worker online! Run the following:

```
wrangler publish
```

If all went according to plan, you should see something like this:

```
Uploaded avatar-remix-bot (1.16 sec)
Published avatar-remix-bot (0.67 sec)
  https://avatar-remix-bot.<yourname>.workers.dev
  Consumer for avatar-remix-jobs
Current Deployment ID: f5d24e08-a211-4bae-a573-e513b5355910
```

If you go to https://avatar-remix-bot.<yourname>.workers.dev, you should see the message "greetings". That means your web application is online and ready to talk with Discord :)

### Register your Interactions Endpoint URL

On the "General Information" tab of your Application's settings in the developer portal, scroll down and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to the URL of your Cloudflare Worker.

The URL was outputted in the previous step, and typically it is of the form https://avatar-remix-bot.<yourname>.workers.dev.

![here's where the interaction endpoint url is set](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/310310/223584868-ce3bc51d-fe8c-4255-a1d0-7c528d8c06f8.png)

Once you've clicked Save Changes, Discord will test your endpoint and you will get a success message, indicating the bot is online.

### Register slash commands

This bots uses a `/remix` slash command, and you must register the slash command before using it for the first time. Register it by hitting the register endpoint with a `POST` request:

```sh
curl -X POST https://avatar-remix-bot.<yourname>.workers.dev/register
```

The response will just say "Registered commands".

In the future, you'll have to do this any time you've made a change to `commands.ts`.

### Invite it to your server

Your bot is ready to go! Invite it to your server by constructing an invite URL:

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your discord application id>&scope=applications.commands+bot
```

Replace the `client_id` above with the `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` you recorded earlier.

That's all! Use the `/remix` command and start remixing to your heart's content.
